Muraho neza, The past few weeks have been a whirl-wind of emotions. The shock, the disbelief and the angst around the unknown. The Coronavirus pandemic has disrupted our lives in more ways than one and has asked us to reshuffle the way we live, the work landscape being one of the areas that has faced copious amounts of disruption.

For some businesses, it’s meant making tough decisions that in many cases have led to people losing their jobs. The daunting responsibility that business owners are facing goes well beyond this unprecedented event. Many of you are probably wondering how to keep the team morale up and brainstorming on ways to pick up the pieces of your organization once this is over.

As we continue to work together in staying healthy during this new normal, we want to ensure that we at Right Seat are doing our part in helping our business community thrive not just economically but also, holistically. There are so many moving pieces of a business that are often overshadowed by day-to-day operations. For many, there’s hardly enough time to strategize or sharpen the areas that need improvement after a long day's work.

While this is a challenging time, it’s also an opportunity to make a contingency plan that will help you adapt to the new era of doing business. We are committed to helping you come out of this time as a more robust company that is built for the long haul.

To that end, we are offering a select of “pro bono human resource solutions” to support you navigate regulations, furloughs and more for a limited time. If this is something that could be beneficial for your business, please reach out to us at info@rightseat.rw.

We hope this article finds you well and keeping in good spirit despite the challenges right now. No matter what the uncertain presents, we can all rest assured that this too shall pass.

Celine & Denise.
